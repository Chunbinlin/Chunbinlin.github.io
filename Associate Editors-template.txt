Journal of Database Management (JDM)

Request to serve as an Associate Editor of JDM

Dear Prof. Keng Siau,

This is a greeting from Chunbin Lin. I would like to request to serve as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Database Management (JDM).

I am working at Amazon AWS. I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). My research interests are Databases and Information Retrievals.  I published more than 20 papers in top conferences/journals, such as SIGMOD, PVLDB, ICDE, TODS, and VLDB Journal. I am also a reviewer of several international journals like VLDB Journal, TKDE, IJIRR, Information Sciences, and Information Systems. In addition, I am also a program committee of several international conferences like DASFAA, SDM, PAKDD, and ECIR.

I would like to request to serve as an Associate Editor of JDM. I can fulfill the following responsibilities:
 - personally review submitted manuscripts, 
 - advise on journal policy and scope,
 - attract new and established authors and article submissions, and
 - work with the Editor to ensure the ongoing development of the journal

I really appreciate it if you can consider my request. Attached is my resume. 
In addition, I am also interested in becoming one of the members in the editorial review board.
Looking forward to receiving your reply.
