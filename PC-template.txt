Dear Chiara,
I am Chunbin Lin working at Amazon AWS. I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) under the supervision of Prof. Yannis Papakonstantinou. I am writing this email to request to serve as a program committee of ISWC'19.

I can fulfill the following responsibilities to be a program committee:
 - personally review submissions, 
 - attend the Program Committee meeting, 
 - solicit quality papers for submission to the conference, and
 - publicize the conference.

I really appreciate it if you can consider my request. 
PS: Attached is my resume.

Best,
Chunbin
